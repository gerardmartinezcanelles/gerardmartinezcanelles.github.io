# Projects 🚀 

Here are some of my side projects. I genuinely enjoy working on them, and I hope you find them interesting!
They do not follow any particular pattern or logic but usually revolved around endurance sports 🫀, finance 🏦 and technology 🛰️.


I have genuine passion for cycling 🚴, running 🏃 and swimming 🏊 but not triathlon since I can of like them separetly. Do improve in the vertical not in the horizontal, specialization for the win! 💪
