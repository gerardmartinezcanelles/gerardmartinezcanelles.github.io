# Story of a Data Enthusiast

I was born in a small town next to Lleida in Catalonia, called Torre-Serona. It is a quiet foggy town surrounded by fields and farms 🐷. Actually, my family still owns a farm there, which I visit occasionally to escape the hustle and bustle of city life. 

It's not the most exciting nor beautiful place, not even by rural standards, the actual saying is "The best thing about Torre-Serona is leaving it". But it has its charm, I guess. 🤔

However I eventually had to move to Barcelona when I was 18 to study Mathematics and BBA at the University of Barcelona. 
Learn anded a lot there, met amazing people, and had great experiences. After finishing my studies, AI and Data Science started to boom, and I decided to pursue a career in that field. So I did a Master's in Data Science. A lot of brain squeezing those years. 🧠💥

At that point, King Games 🎮 was crazy enough to hire someone like me, a fresh graduate with no experience, and clear problems to distinguish when is it's time to joke around and when to be serious. I did manage to make it a reccurrent point in my yearly reviews, so I guess they appreciated it.

Found my passion at the intersection of Data, Product and Business, and have been working in that area ever since. I could spend hours trying to understand user behavior through data, and finding ways to improve their experience while also driving business growth. Not joking this time, I really love torturing data until it reveals its secrets. 📊
