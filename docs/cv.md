I was born in a small village next to Lleida in Catalonia, called Torre-Serona. It is  quiet foggy and surrounded by fields and farms 🐷. Actually, my family still owns a farm there, which I visit occasionally to escape the hustle and bustle of city life. 🌲

It's not the most exciting nor beautiful place, not even by rural standards, the actual saying is "The best thing about Torre-Serona is leaving it" 🌬️. But it has its charm, I guess. 🤔

Following that saying I eventually had to move to Barcelona when I was 18 to study Mathematics and BBA at the University of Barcelona. 
Learn a lot there, met amazing people, and had great experiences. After finishing my studies, AI and Data Science started to boom, and I decided to pursue a career in that field. So I did a Master's in Data Science. A lot of brain squeezing those years. 🧠💥

At that point, King Games 🎮 was crazy enough to hire someone like me, a fresh graduate with no experience 🥴, and clear problems to distinguish when is it's time to joke around and when to be serious. I did manage to make it a reccurrent point in my yearly reviews, so I guess they appreciated it. 😜

Found my passion at the intersection of Data, Product and Experimentation, and have been working in that area ever since. I could spend hours trying to understand user behavior through data, and finding ways to improve their experience while also driving business growth. Not joking this time, I really love torturing data until it reveals its secrets. 📊 🧐
