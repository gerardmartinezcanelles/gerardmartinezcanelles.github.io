# Welcome 

This is my personal website! Here you can find my CV, projects, and more.

The original idea was to keep things professional, but I’ve failed miserably at taking life seriously as a functional adult. So here I am, trying to make the best out of it! 🤷‍♂️

In fact, humor, comedy, satire and generally being a bit of a goofball are what I do best. So if you keep reading, you might even get a free laugh at some point. 😄

The image above clearly does not represent me, I am one of those that always says "Yes" to new adventures and opportunities!  🚀 

So feel free to drop a message and you will probably get a YES from my side no matter how crazy your proposal is.
