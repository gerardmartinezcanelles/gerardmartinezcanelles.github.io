# Welcome 🦊

This is my personal website! Here you can find my CV, projects, and more.

The original idea was to keep things professional, but I’ve failed miserably at taking life seriously as a functional adult. So here I am, trying to make the best out of it! 🤷‍♂️

In fact, humor, comedy, satire and generally being a bit of a goofball are what I do best. So if you keep reading, you might even get a free laugh at some point. 😄

That image is me in a nutshell: always ready with a joke, even when the situation couldn’t be more serious. Humor is my default setting.

So feel free to drop a message !! Worst case, you’ll get a laugh, and maybe even a fruitful exchange. Always open to learning!
