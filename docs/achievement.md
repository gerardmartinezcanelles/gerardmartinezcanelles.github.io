The actual achievements 🏆 I'm actually proud of 🎉  
Not the papers, not the production pipelines, not the models… but the *real* milestones that define my journey as a human being:  


- 🦖 Scored **2532** in the Chrome Dino Game (personal record).  
- I rememeber that day that I was happy, that sunny 30th of February 2020 🥺.
- ⏰ Snoozed the alarm **7 times in a row** and still made it to work on time.  
- 💻 Successfully fixed a bug by **adding just one semicolon**.  
- 🐍 Wrote a Python script called `final_final_really_final.py` only **3 times**.  
- ☕ Survived a full-day hackathon with only **two cups of coffee**.
